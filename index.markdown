## Summary

Being platform-, language-, software-, hardware-, and human-agnostic, I can make an impact on any project and/or team starting day one. Apart from my experience as an engineer in various business and technological fields, I also bring exceptional analytical skills and creativity. I don’t take "that is hard" as an answer from myself.

I love working with people. I enjoy helping them gain experience and build confidence in themselves. From my perspective, experience gained through self-education and learning by doing is incredibly valuable. However, from my own experience, it’s also extremely demanding and far more challenging than having someone to guide you. That’s why I am passionate about mentoring and sharing knowledge to make the journey easier for others.

In teamwork, I aim to absorb as many different perspectives as possible to help the team function effectively and avoid uncertainties or conflicts. I value open and honest communication and am never silent when I see room for improvement. Whether it’s resolving long-standing issues or implementing small fixes to improve a team’s day-to-day workflow, I persistently advocate for solutions until they are achieved.

I believe that, in business, people are the only real asset because everything else is or was created by other people. I stand for the absolute and total equality of all individuals, as well as the power of our socially connected nature. Together, we create amazing things.
