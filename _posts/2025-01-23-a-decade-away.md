title:  "A decade away"
---

It is somewhere around a decade passed since I started thinking about my blog, my youtube chanel and other social endeavours.

On my way to be a good creator and to understand what is it about I want to create, I:
* completely reorganized, overcame and rediscovered myself
* moved to another country
* learned two new human and three computer programming languages
* switched many jobs and lost one
* met amazing people
* almost died twice (maybe exaggerating a little but still)
* learned lots and lots of fascinating thing about the universe which completely changed my understanding of it
* proved myself that I am worthy (which was a complete waist of time, to be honest)
* survived years long depression
* quit smoking and drinking alcohol

And now ten years later I finally know what I am, what I want to tell you and how I want to do that.

My name is Pavel Perminov. I am IT guy by day and ADHD person by night. I want to share my experience, my struggle and my way in hope that someone else will find it useful, funny, insightful or interesting.

Welcome to my life.
